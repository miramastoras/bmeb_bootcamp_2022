# bmeb_bootcamp_2022

This repository holds project information and code for the 2022 incoming BMEB grad students bootcamp. 

Our mini-project will have two parts:

### Part 1: De-novo assembly of a "mystery" covid genome
In [part 1](https://github.com/miramastoras/bmeb_bootcamp_2022/blob/main/covid_assembly.md), you will work individually to assemble a covid genome, call variants against the covid reference, and use USHER to determine what strain of the viruss your mystery assembly belongs to. 


### Part 2: Exploratory COVID project 
In part 2, you have the option to research a COVID related question that interests you, ideally making use of the assembly you created in part 1. You may work in groups of 2-3, or individually. Ultimately, the goal is to have interesting results to present to your fellow bootcampers on the last day. This part will be less structured than part 1, to give you the opportunity to ask your own research questions and figure out how to answer them yourself.

We've set up some preliminary analyses in three different research areas to get you started. If none of these interest you, and you have your own idea, please feel free to follow that! 

- Option 1: Phylogenetic analysis 
- [Option 2](https://github.com/miramastoras/bmeb_bootcamp_2022/blob/main/AlphaFold_gcloud.md): Predicting the protein structure of your assembly spike protein with AlphaFold 
- [Option 3](https://github.com/miramastoras/bmeb_bootcamp_2022/blob/main/pt2-multiple-aln.md): Multiple Alignment of SARS-CoV-2 Genomes for Variant Surveillance
